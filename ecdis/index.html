# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** January 12, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **Volodymyr Reida** (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you use **MaritimeHub** (including the **MaritimeHub ECDIS** module) (the “App”).

## 1) Overview (Offline-first)

The App is designed to work primarily offline. It does not require creating an account, and we do not operate a backend server to collect your personal data.

## 2) Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information you provide

You may enter or import navigation-related data, such as:

* Routes and waypoints you create
* Route files you choose to import (e.g., RTZ routes)

### 2.2 Location information (when you enable it)

If you enable GPS inside the App, the App uses your device location to display the vessel position and compute navigation values (e.g., COG/SOG/DTG/ETA).

### 2.3 On-device storage (local)

To provide continuity between sessions, the App may store certain data **locally on your device**, such as saved routes and past track history (for example using WebView local storage). This data stays on your device unless you delete it.

### 2.4 PRO / in-app purchase status

The App may support a PRO unlock flow. The App can initiate a purchase request and can receive purchase status updates to enable or restrict PRO features.
**We do not collect or store your payment card details.** Purchases are handled by Google Play, and any payment information is processed by Google, not by us.

## 3) How We Use Information

We use the information described above only to:

* Display your position (if enabled) and show navigation information
* Create, edit, import, and display routes/waypoints
* Draw and restore a past track (if the feature exists in your version)
* Enable/disable PRO features based on purchase status

## 4) Data Sharing

We do **not** sell your personal information.

We do **not** share your routes, waypoints, or past track with third parties because they are stored locally on your device.

### Third-party services

* **Google Play Billing / Google Play Services:** Used to process in-app purchases and provide purchase status to the App. Google’s processing is governed by Google’s own policies.

## 5) Map Data and Attribution (Natural Earth)

The App may use map data from **Natural Earth**, which is provided in the **public domain**. Natural Earth data is used as a base map/background for visualization.

## 6) Permissions (Mobile Device)

Depending on how your build is configured, the App may request:

* **Location** permission — to show vessel position when GPS is enabled
* **File access / storage** permission — only if you use route import features (e.g., selecting an RTZ file)
* **Internet** permission — may be required for Google Play purchase flow and any optional online features

## 7) Optional Online Features (if enabled in your build)

Some versions of the App may include optional online features (for example, online weather). If you use such features, the App may send user-entered data (and/or coordinates required for the feature) to the selected service provider. We do not control how third-party services process data, and their policies apply.

## 8) Data Retention

Because routes and past track data are stored locally on your device, they remain there until you remove them by:

* using the App’s clear/reset functions (if available), or
* clearing the App storage in your device settings, or
* uninstalling the App.

## 9) Security

We take reasonable steps to minimize data handling by keeping it on-device. However, no method of storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 10) Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 11) Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” at the top indicates when it was last revised.

## 12) Contact

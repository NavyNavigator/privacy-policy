    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> January 12, 2026</p>
    <hr>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Volodymyr Reida</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information
      when you use <strong>MaritimeHub</strong> (including the <strong>MaritimeHub ECDIS</strong> module) (the “App”).
    </p>

    <h2>1) Overview (Offline-first)</h2>
    <p>
      The App is designed to work primarily offline. It does not require creating an account, and we do not operate a
      backend server to collect your personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <p>You may enter or import navigation-related data, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Routes and waypoints you create</li>
      <li>Route files you choose to import (e.g., RTZ routes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Location information (when you enable it)</h3>
    <p>
      If you enable GPS inside the App, the App uses your device location to display the vessel position and compute
      navigation values (e.g., COG/SOG/DTG/ETA).
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 On-device storage (local)</h3>
    <p>
      To provide continuity between sessions, the App may store certain data <strong>locally on your device</strong>,
      such as saved routes and past track history (for example using WebView local storage). This data stays on your
      device unless you delete it.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 PRO / in-app purchase status</h3>
    <p>
      The App may support a PRO unlock flow. The App can initiate a purchase request and can receive purchase status
      updates to enable or restrict PRO features. <strong>We do not collect or store your payment card details.</strong>
      Purchases are handled by Google Play, and any payment information is processed by Google, not by us.
    </p>

    <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information described above only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display your position (if enabled) and show navigation information</li>
      <li>Create, edit, import, and display routes/waypoints</li>
      <li>Draw and restore a past track (if the feature exists in your version)</li>
      <li>Enable/disable PRO features based on purchase status</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information.</p>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> share your routes, waypoints, or past track with third parties because they are stored
      locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-party services</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Play Billing / Google Play Services:</strong> Used to process in-app purchases and provide
        purchase status to the App. Google’s processing is governed by Google’s own policies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Map Data and Attribution (Natural Earth)</h2>
    <p>
      The App may use map data from <strong>Natural Earth</strong>, which is provided in the <strong>public domain</strong>.
      Natural Earth data is used as a base map/background for visualization.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Permissions (Mobile Device)</h2>
    <p>Depending on how your build is configured, the App may request:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location</strong> permission — to show vessel position when GPS is enabled</li>
      <li><strong>File access / storage</strong> permission — only if you use route import features (e.g., selecting an RTZ file)</li>
      <li><strong>Internet</strong> permission — may be required for Google Play purchase flow and any optional online features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Optional Online Features (if enabled in your build)</h2>
    <p>
      Some versions of the App may include optional online features (for example, online weather). If you use such features,
      the App may send user-entered data (and/or coordinates required for the feature) to the selected service provider.
      We do not control how third-party services process data, and their policies apply.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Because routes and past track data are stored locally on your device, they remain there until you remove them by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>using the App’s clear/reset functions (if available), or</li>
      <li>clearing the App storage in your device settings, or</li>
      <li>uninstalling the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to minimize data handling by keeping it on-device. However, no method of storage is 100% secure,
      and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” at the top indicates when it was last revised.
    </p>
